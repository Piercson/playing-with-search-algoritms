# playing-with-search-algoritms
Experimenting amount of searched nodes with Dijkstra, A-Start, and Landmark searches. 

Project for class on data structures and algorithms.
  gave a txt file of 1000 nodes with postions and edges
  needed to discuss the comparison of dijkstra, a*, and landmark searches.
